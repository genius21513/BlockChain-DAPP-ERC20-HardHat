Originally I tried to use the hardhat testnet.
But hardhat cannot send my token between accounts.


So-->

I changed my test network from hardhat to goerli test network.
already deployed at blockchain this smartcontract
So, you may use client (webapp.)

-------Terminal
cd webapp
yarn
yarn dev

---Token Address
at src/pages/index.tsx
you will change the "const contractAddress=" section


------->After I will to be run by hardhat!!!
Thank you.
